# Eris stealer
____________________________________________________________________
 
this project has been inactive for a while and that's because I don't want to make functional malware available to any skid with an internet connection, so all you get is a barely usable piece of software that could be used for demonstrations but that's it.

## About

Eris is offensive security software made for fun and as a learning project, as a result it's pretty basic and bare, however it provides a lot of useful functionality that's found in similar pieces of software (please don't use for bad stuffs UwU).

Not really meant to be practical in any way, kinda just made for fun and as a learning project.

very bad code indeed, very buggy oh no <img src="https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/avatar/twitch/406440657" alt="SADGE" style="height:20px; width:20px">
